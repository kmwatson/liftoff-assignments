## Submission Instructions

### Overview

I have chosen to create an app that will allow people with disabilities to rate their experiences at different tourist destinations. One of my close friends has limited mobility and she loves to travel, especially abroad, but some historical landmarks have very limited accommodations. She still wants to visit but being able to know in advance what she can expect when she gets there would allow her to better plan and have a much better traveling experience. This app would allow users to create profiles, search, and read and write reviews for different locations. 
   
### Features

Features include:

 User login:
 Users will be abal to access their user accounts to make changes, schedule events, or check for event notifications in their area. 

 Search capabilities:
 Users can search by location, type of tourist destination, the best spots as rated by other people with similar mobility issues, or other search criteria. 

 Reviews:
 Users can write a review of a destination they visited based on how easy it was to navigate and read reviews from other users.

 Save destinations:
 Users can save places they want to visit to their profile to plan their trip.
 
 
### Technologies

 This project will use a React/JavaScript front end, SpringBoot/Java back end, and SQL. 


### What I'll Have to Learn

I'll have to learn React for front end and supplement my knowledge to use REST APIs to bring the front end and back end together
